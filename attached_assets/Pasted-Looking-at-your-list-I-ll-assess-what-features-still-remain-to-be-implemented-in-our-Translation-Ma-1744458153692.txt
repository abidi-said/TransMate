Looking at your list, I'll assess what features still remain to be implemented in our Translation Management System:

PostgreSQL database integration with Drizzle ORM:

Partially implemented - We have the database created now, but we need to finish the integration with Drizzle ORM
Need to create proper migration scripts and finalize the schema
Real-time collaborative editing with WebSockets:

Not implemented yet
Need to set up WebSocket server and client connections
Implement collaborative editing features with conflict resolution
Enhanced role-based permission system:

Basic structure exists but needs full implementation
Need to expand roles beyond admin/user (e.g., translator, reviewer, project manager)
Implement permission checks throughout the application
Advanced analytics dashboard:

Not implemented yet
Need to create data aggregation and visualization components
Implement reporting on translation metrics, user performance, etc.
Machine learning for translation quality prediction:

Not implemented yet
Requires integration with OpenAI API for quality scoring
Need to develop training and prediction pipeline
Translation memory leveraging user corrections:

Basic structure exists but needs full implementation
Need to implement fuzzy matching algorithms
Add feedback loop from user corrections
Automated quality assurance tools:

Not implemented yet
Need to create consistency checks, terminology validation
Implement automated test suites for translations
Enhanced Git integration with branch management:

Not implemented yet
Need to integrate with Git APIs
Create branch management UI and merge workflows
I've just set up a PostgreSQL database for the project. Would you like me to focus on implementing the database integration with Drizzle ORM first? This would provide the foundation for many of the other features.

do what remain  please,
and also:
Convert client side app and admin side app to dashboards
Improve component compositions into small components, and make them reusable
Improve security
Improve readme file with services presentaion and manual use build/install/run, instructions how to configure .env from .env.example and list APIs and how to configure them, add features sample of test account email/password for admin and client to test the app
